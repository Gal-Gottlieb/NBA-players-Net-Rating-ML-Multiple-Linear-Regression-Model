# Multiple Linear Regression Model project on NBA player's net ratings using machine learning

For this project, I developed a Machine Learning Linear Regression model that determines a player's expected net rating by using a variety of factors.

The data for this analysis was pulled from a CSV file named all_seasons.csv from the following Kaggle profile:

* The CSV file is available in the repository.

I performed the following in Python during the project preparation:

1- Data exploration.

2- Data cleaning and preparation.

3- ETL - Extracting Transforming Loading process.

4- Feature engineering.

5- Data exploration.

6- Data explanation.

7- Data preprocessing for the model.

8- Model Building.

9- Model evaluation.

10- Model improvement and re-evaluation.

11- Data visualization.

I uploaded the Python script to the repository.



The project process, findings, and insights are outlined in a PowerPoint presentation.
The PowerPoint file is uploaded to the repository.
