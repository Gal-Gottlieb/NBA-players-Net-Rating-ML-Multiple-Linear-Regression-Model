# Multiple Linear Regression Model project on NBA player's net ratings using machine learning

For this project, I developed a model that determines a player's expected net rating by using a variety of factors.

The data for this analysis is taken from a csv file named all_seasons.csv in the following Kaggle profile:

* The CSV file is available in the repository.

The following tasks were carried out in Python during project preparation:

1- Data exploration.
2- Data cleaning and preparation.
3- ETL - Extracting Transforming Loading process.
4- Feature engineering.
5- Data exploration.
6- Data explanation.
7- Data preprocessing for the model.
8- Model Building.
9- Model evaluation.
10- Model improving and re-evaluation.
